# Hello-World
Just a little test how to work with Github
yoo yoo, i am jay and want to learn JS, HTMl, and CCS to add it to my portfolio.

I have made an account on hackthebox and i made some progress in it by doing a couple of challanges.
Now i am about to make my way through hackthebox Academy to learn about the fundamentals and other stuff in the IT world.
